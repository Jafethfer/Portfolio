## Interactive Portfolio

A portfolio is a tool a professional use to give an introduction about his experience, jobs, attitude, hobbies, etc. With this in mind, 
I have prepared a portfolio that will hopefully describe me not only as an experienced web developer, but also as a charismatic human being. 

This portfolio has been made without templates, meaning it has been done from an empty canvas. 

All the assets used in the portfolio are property of SNK Corporation, inspired by my favorite fighting arcade video game, I decided to give the portfolio
an "arcade feeling" with sound effects, animations, and fonts that will approach as closely as possible to the original product from SNK.

The music and sound effects can be muted if needed. 

The portfolio is available at the following github pages url:
